<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lab, I evaluated two AI tools, Adobe Firefly and Claude. Using frameworks focused on capabilities, appropriate use, and ethical considerations.</p>

<h2>Tool 1: Adobe Firefly</h2>
<p><h3>Evidence: Prompts + Outputs</h3>
<div class="prompt-card">
<h4>Adobe Firefly Prompt 1: Photo generation</h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong>
Make a watercolor picture of a black lab dog at the beach with a blonde girl petting or hugging him. 
</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

I tested Adobe Firefly's image making abilities.        

Adobe Firefly is really good at quickly generating images, graphics, and design elements that look polished and professional. I found it especially useful for creating visual concepts and backgrounds that could easily be edited in Photoshop afterward. However, it fell short when it came to detailed accuracy and text inside images, which often looked distorted or incorrect.

A good use case for Firefly is brainstorming and early-stage design work, like creating mood boards, social media visuals, or concept art. It’s helpful when you need ideas fast rather than a final product. A poor use case would be anything that requires high precision or exact text, such as technical diagrams or finished typography-heavy designs.

One concern with using Firefly is copyright and whether artists’ work is being used without permission. Adobe addresses this by training Firefly on licensed and public-domain content and labeling AI-generated work with content credentials. Even with these safeguards, there are still concerns around bias and over-reliance on AI in creative fields.

<h2>Tool 2: Claude</h2>
<p>
To complement my evaluation of Adobe Firefly's visual design capabilities,
I tested Claude as a text-based AI assistant with a focus on accessibility,
ethical reasoning, and transparency.
</p>

<h3>Evidence: Prompts + Outputs</h3>
<div class="prompt-card">
<h4>Claude Prompt 1: Accessibility-Focused Short Story</h4>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong>
Write a short story about this watercolor photo to possible users with cognitive disabilities and low vision.
</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p> After giving Claude the photo that Adobe Firely had generated and the prompt above, Claude generated this short story in seconds:</p>
    <p> <strong>The Last Summer:</strong>
Emma had known since spring that this would be their final beach trip together. Shadow was twelve now, his muzzle graying, and the vet's words echoed every time she looked at him. But here, with the salt air and waves singing their ancient song, none of that mattered. She wrapped her arms around his broad chest and pressed her cheek against his neck, feeling the steady thump of his heartbeat—still strong, still here.
Shadow leaned into her embrace the way he always had, since she was small enough to toddle into his patience. He'd been her companion through scraped knees and lost friends, through every storm. The waves crashed and retreated, and Emma held on tighter, trying to memorize everything: the warmth of his fur, the weight of his trust, the way the sunset painted them both in gold.
"I've got you," she whispered. And for one perfect moment, with the ocean as their witness, time stood still." </p>
<p><strong>Claude’s Accessibility Notes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p> Claude AI is especially good at writing emotionally rich, human-sounding stories. In the short story it generated, the language felt natural and detailed, and it handled tone and pacing really well without feeling robotic. However, while it excels at narrative and reflection, it’s less useful for visual creation or structured design work.
A good use case for Claude is creative writing, storytelling, brainstorming ideas, or reflective pieces where tone and emotion matter. It works well for drafts, personal narratives, or expanding on ideas you already have. A poor use case would be highly technical tasks, data-heavy analysis, or projects that require visuals or exact formatting.
One ethical concern with Claude is how closely AI-generated writing can imitate human emotion and voice, which raises questions about originality and authorship. The developers address this by emphasizing responsible use and discouraging harmful or deceptive content. Still, users need to be transparent about when AI is being used in creative work.</p>

<h2>Broader Reflection</h2>

<h3>Personal Use</h3>
<p>I use AI tools in my academic and professional work as support rather than a replacement for my own thinking. For school, AI can be helpful for brainstorming, organizing ideas, or to help get unstuck when I’m starting something. In a professional setting, I see it as a way to speed up early stages of work, like generating concepts or analyzing patterns, while still relying on my own judgment to finalize things. Using AI appropriately, to me, means being honest about when it’s used and making sure the final outcome still reflects my voice, work, and intent. 

Within the Digital Culture and Data Analytics program, AI tools could have a big impact on the skills being taught. Positively, they can help students learn faster, experiment more, and work with larger sets of data or creative outputs. AI can also make technical skills feel easier or accessible. On the negative side, there’s a risk of over-reliance, where students skip the learning process and let AI do the thinking for them. What still remains human in DCDA work is critical thinking, ethical decision-making, creativity, and awareness. Understanding why something matters, not just how to generate it.

Because AI tools evolve so quickly, it’s important to ask the right questions when trying new things. Who made this tool, and how can I trust it? What are its limitations and biases? Am I allowed to use the outputs ethically and legally? Most importantly, does this tool actually help me think better, or does it just help me work faster?
