<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
<p> For this lab, I used the Top Baby Names by State dataset, which includes the most popular baby names by state, year, gender, and number of occurrences. When I uploaded the CSV into Tableau Public, it loaded without major errors, but I still had to double-check that each column was in there correctly.
Tableau automatically recognized State, Gender, and Top Name as text fields, while Year and Occurrences were numeric. I made sure that Occurrences was treated as a measure so it could be counted and compared, and that Year functioned as a continuous timeline for trend analysis. The file imported easily, but I still checked to make sure that the charts displayed the data accurately.

<h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>

<h3>Design Choices</h3>
<p>
<!-- Write here -->
To explore baby name popularity, I built a dashboard with three visuals that each show a different pattern. First, I made a line chart to show how name popularity changes over time. I used Year on the x-axis and Occurrences on the y-axis, and color-coded by gender. I included names like Ava, Emma, James, Jennifer, Jessica, John, Katherine, Liam, Mary, Matthew, Michael, and William because they represent different time periods and trends.
Next, I created a map to look at regional differences. I filtered it to focus on the name Katherine to see where it appears most often across the U.S., which made the analysis feel more personal.
Finally, I added a bar chart comparing total male and female name popularity to highlight differences between genders.
I chose these visuals because together they make it easy to see trends over time, geographic patterns, and gender differences in one place.
<p>

<h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
<p>
Before making the Name Popularity Over Time graph, I expected to see more traditional names dominate in the early decades and then slowly decline as naming choices became more diverse. I also thought male names would stay more consistent, while female names would change more often because of trends and cultural influences. The graph mostly confirmed this. The male line stays fairly steady and peaks around the mid-1900s, suggesting a few boy names stayed popular for a long time. The female line, however, rises and falls much more sharply, showing that girls’ names tend to follow trend cycles instead of staying consistent. Both lines drop after the 1990s, which supports the idea that modern parents are choosing more unique names rather than one dominant favorite.
<p>

<h3>Surprises and Outliers</h3>
<p>One thing that stood out to me while creating my visuals was that ​I felt like parts of my graphs were a little hard to read and somewhat confusing at first. Some of the results and overlaps made it difficult to understand what was happening without taking extra time to interpret the data. Even so, after looking more closely, the chart still suggests that girls’ names were historically concentrated around a few dominant choices, while boys’ names were spread across several consistently popular ones. I also had trouble uploading my dashboard to Tableau. I wasn’t sure what was working, but after a few tries, it finally worked, so that was another bug that I ran into. Another interesting thing I saw was that at first, I tried a different data set, but it was in an “xlsx” format, and Tableau and VS Code would not take that data set, so I tried this one, which was a csv, and it worked right away.
