<h2>What I did with AI assistance</h2>
<p> For this lab, I used AI to enhance and debug my portfolio website. I prompted Claude Sonnet 4.6 to add subtle CSS animations across all HTML pages, including hover effects, smooth fade-ins, and lift/shadow interactions to improve user experience while maintaining a clean, professional style. I also used AI to scan my site for broken links and structural issues and automatically fix them.

    <h2> Key Code Concepts & Understanding </h2>
    <p>The animations use CSS transitions and keyframes instead of JavaScript, which keeps them fast and smooth. The fade-ins work by changing opacity and position, and hover effects use transforms and timing functions to create subtle movement. Even though AI generated the code, I understand how these effects improve usability and visual flow. At first, I easily noticed the fade-in, staggered fade-in-up, and lift + shadow when I previewed my website. However, I don’t really know what the other ones did right from the get-go. The chat then asked me if they wanted to implement it for me, and I said yes, and then I pressed keep, and it was all updated for me, super easily.

    <h2>Vibe Coding Guidelines & Reflection</h2>
    <p>This lab showed me how helpful AI can be for quickly adding features and debugging issues. It lets me experiment and build things I might not fully know how to code yet. At the same time, I want to make sure I understand what the code is doing and not rely on AI for foundational skills I’m still learning. With that, I think that vibe coding has really helped me as a coder. In class, I really enjoyed the day we got to play around with AI and create the ‘frog on a skateboard.’ It was fun because I realized I can even create a game, even if I don’t fully understand the code yet. However, you could see this as hindering my learning of coding because I am basically relying on AI to do all of it. But overall, I think it is a really helpful tool. I think that proper attribution in an academic context means acknowledging what you are using the AI for and how much you are using it. It is very helpful for debugging things and helping me know where I went wrong. In a professional setting, attribution may not be required, but you should understand what you are doing. 

Going forward, I plan to use AI for debugging, optimization suggestions, and trying/learning new techniques for games and vibe coding, too. I will avoid relying on it for foundational skills that I am practicing.

    <p>These screenshots are examples of what Claude Sonnet 4.6 gave me after I entered my prompts. Throughout this lab, I took notes on AI's output, and I analyzed them throughout each section of my reflection. </p>
