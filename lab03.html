            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The “Glove Rose” by Jeremy Wanner caught my eye as I was scrolling the Data to Art website as I love the look of watercolor flowers. The data translates Olympic boxing match analytics into digital art roses, creating what the artist calls “Rosa Pugilatu.” It measures punch trajectories, match outcomes, and strike metrics, collected by the PerfAnalytics research team using markerless computer vision technology during the French Olympic Qualification Tournament. 
Wanner explains that roses grow “in the direction of the outcome of a fight” and that thorns represent “blows to the opponent,” but even with a map legend, the actual mapping between data and form is kind of unclear. With the main initial photo shown, some key details are missing: which matches are being shown, what different colors or sizes mean, or how thorn placement relates to specific punches. Without this information, it is hard to reconstruct the original data or judge whether the visualization is accurate.
The data itself is scientific and exact, but the final product feels mystical and artistic. The Glove Rose is unfamiliar for sports visuzliation, but rather shows mood and symbolism. It makes me feel peace and beauty, rather than focusing on boxing and the aggression that comes with the sport. 
</p>

            <h3> Metaphor & Meaning </h3>
            <p>I think when looking at this data as art, someone could definitely say that they would question the meaning of the data representation and realize that there is a metaphor displayed within the art and analysis. When I see a flowers I think of beauty, thoughtfulness, and care, which creates a contrast when this is applied to a violent sport like boxing. By turning punches into flowers, Wanner must want us to see boxing through a different lens. He must want us to think about the grace, practice, and some sort of aesthetic qualities in athletic boxing. Thinking about this metaphor can raise some confusion and questions. The idea that the punches are thorns is interesting. Are the longer thorns longer punches? The symbolism feels clever but the data is not very clear for the viewer. We could also think about how roses are usually associated with femininity and romance, which could clash with boxing's usually masculine culture. That contrast could open up conversations about how we look at beauty and value different sports or forms of physicality. Overall, the metaphor leans more toward evoking a feeling rather than clarity. </p>

            <h3>Accessibility </h3>
            <p>I think accessibility is one of the Glove Rose’s weaknesses. Even with a legend rose, the visualization is kind of hard to interpret without specizalied knowledge. Unlike usual charts with labeled axes and clear scales, these organic forms aren’t as easy to understand. To understand the piece you may need some background knowledge in boxing, the technology, data visuliazation, and conceptual art all at the same time. This makes this piece of art feel unintentionally exclusive. A boxing fanantic might appreciate the sport but not really understand the data side. Someone who knows data visualization might miss what is happening in the boxing matches. The result is a piece that looks visually interesting and sparks conversation, but doesn’t work well as something you can actually learn from. Most people can admire how it looks, but few could explain what it is meant to show. </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Glove Rose works well as art, but not as well as a data visualization for me. I think Wanner created something visually interesting that makes people think differently about boxing, violence, and beauty, but it falls short when it comes to understanding the actual data. As a viewer, I can’t easily pull real insights about boxing performance or be confident the visuals accurately reflect what happened in the matches (without reading the article or seeing the other photos included). Overall, the project makes me question whether it’s meant to explain information or just use data as creative inspiration. Glove Rose leans more toward expression than explanation, showing the difference between making something beautiful and making something clear.</p>
